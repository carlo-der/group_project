    <h2>Digital Footprint</h2>
    <p>What is digital footprint?</p>
    <p>Your digital footprint is the trail of data that you leave behind when you use the internet. It can be used to track your online activity, so you should be careful when thinking about what to post online.</p>
    <p>When thinking about your digital footprint, you should think about these things:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What you post and who can access it</li>
        <li>Consider which details are necessary and unnecessary</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With this in mind, let's think about what information is necessary to share online and what is not</p>

    <h2>Spotting and reporting fake accounts</h2>

    <p>Fake accounts on social media can be very dangerous for many reasons, and it is very important that we can avoid them. Below are some of the reasons why fake accounts can be dangerous.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Trickery: Fake accounts could be pretending to be someone else, like a friend or celebrity</li>
        <li>Cyberbullying: Some accounts are created to harass and bully others online</li>
        <li>Scams: Scam accounts may offer prizes or other cool things in return for personal information or bank details</li>
        <li>Privacy Risks: Following and interacting with fake accounts can result in accidental sharing of information. This could lead to cyber and potentially real life danger</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Some of these risks can be very serious, but they are also very preventable! Below are some tips on how to recognise fake accounts.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>If an account has a date on it that indicates the set-up of the account</li>
        <li>Usernames made up of seemingly random numbers and letters</li>
        <li>Lots of followers with no posts or on a new account (followers can be bought)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If any of these things seem to fit with an account that attempts to follow or interact with you, it is best and safest to not engage and to block the account.</p>

    <p>If a friend or family member posts or messages something out of the ordinary (this is usually a link of some sort) do not click on it as their account may have been hacked. You should contact the person another way and let them know that their account may have been hacked.</p>
