        <h2><strong>Why do Cyber Security laws exist?</strong></h2>
        <P>Cyber Security laws are very important to protecting us online. Some reasons for why we need these laws
            include:</P>
        <ul>
            <li>Cybersecurity laws protect personal and sensitive information from being stolen or misused.</li>
            <li>They help prevent cybercrimes such as hacking, identity theft, and fraud.</li>
            <li>Cybersecurity laws promote trust and confidence in online transactions and communication.</li>
            <li>They establish standards and guidelines for organisations to follow in order to secure their digital
                infrastructure.
            </li>
            <li>These laws hold individuals and organisations accountable for their actions in cyberspace.</li>
            <li>They ensure that businesses and governments take appropriate measures to safeguard digital assets and
                critical infrastructure.
            </li>
            <li>Cybersecurity laws help maintain national security by protecting against cyber threats from foreign
                entities.
            </li>
            <li>They facilitate international cooperation and information sharing to combat cyber threats on a global
                scale.

    <h2>Cyberbullying</h2>
    <p>Cyberbullying is when someone uses the internet or social media to hurt, threaten, or embarrass others. It's
        against the law in many places because it can be very harmful. If you're being cyberbullied, it's important to
        tell a trusted adult. Among the young age group of 10-15, cyber bullying remains the most likely form of
        bullying compared to in person bullying. This is because people can hide behind a screen without having to face
        consequences for their actions face to face. It's important to know that cyber bullying is hateful, and you
        should treat people online how you would want to be treated. Be kind to one another!</p>

    <h2>Online Safety Laws</h2>
    <p>There are laws that protect people online, just like there are laws that protect us in real life. For example,
        hacking into someone else's account or spreading harmful content online can be illegal and have <b>serious</b>
        consequences.</p>

    <h2>Copyright Laws</h2>
    <p>Copyright laws protect people's work, like songs, videos, and pictures, from being used without permission. It's
        important to respect other people's work online and not use it without their permission. Using someone else's
        work without payment or permission can result in legal trouble including fines and in rare cases,
        imprisonment.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Privacy Laws</h2>
    Privacy laws help protect our personal information online. It's important to be careful about what we share online
    and to respect other people's privacy too. Spying on someone or sharing their personal information without
    permission can be against the law. Online platforms often have privacy policies that outline how they collect, use,
    and share personal data. It's crucial to read and understand these policies to safeguard your privacy online.
    <hr>
    <h2>Reporting Cybercrimes</h2>
    <p>If you see something online that's illegal or harmful, it's important to tell a trusted adult or report it to the
        proper authorities. Reporting cybercrimes helps make the internet safer for everyone. If you feel you are
        immediate danger from a Cybercrime, please do contact your local authority.</p>
