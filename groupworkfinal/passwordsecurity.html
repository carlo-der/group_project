                <h2>What is passsword security and why is it important?</h2>
                <p>Password security means keeping your passwords safe and hard for others to guess or steal. Strong,
                    unique
                    passwords should be created for each account you have and these should remain secret. </p>
                <p>So, what makes a password strong and secure? Following these 4 rules will help you to have an
                    unguessable
                    password!</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Avoid repetition and common strings. e.g., 1234 or 1111</li>
                    <li>Avoid using common words. e.g., Password</li>
                    <li>Use special characters. e.g., %, Â£, !, * etc</li>
                    <li>Do not share your passwords with others!</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Select which passwords you think are secure below and type in your own to see how secure it is!</p>

                <h3>Things to remember!</h3>
                <p>Even if your password is very hard to guess, writing them all down in an unsecured area such as a
                    notes page
                    can reduce the security massively and they could be stolen! Make sure you store your passwords
                    safely and DO
                    NOT SHARE THEM!</p>

            <h2>Two Factor Authentication</h2>

            <p>2-step verification is a way of <q>double checking</q> that the person attempting to use your account is
                you. This is important as you do not want strangers accessing your banking or social media accounts for
                example.

                If you use 2 Factor Authentication, then even if someone knows your password, they will not be able to
                access any protected accounts. </p>

            <h2>Another way to create passwords!</h2>

            <p>If creating a long random password doesn't work for you, consider using this method!
                <br/>
                The NCSC recommends a simple way of creating an easy to remember, but hard to guess password!
                <br/>
                All you have to do is pick 3 random words that are memorable to you! Its that easy!
            </p>
            <p>Some examples of random passwords you could have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>sunshinebicyclegalaxy</li>
                <li>Whispermountainfirefly4</li>
                <li>DragonBubbleSymphony!27</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All these examples could be easily remembered but hard to guess. You can even customise them to fit with
                password requirements (including numbers, special characters etc)</p>
