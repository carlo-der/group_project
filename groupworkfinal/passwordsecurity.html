		<h2>What is passsword security and why is it important?</h2>
		<p>Password security means keeping your passwords safe and hard for others to guess or steal. Strong, unique passwords should be created for each account you have and these should remain secret. </p>
		<p>So, what makes a password strong and secure? Following these 4 rules will help you to have an unguessable password!</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Avoid repetition and common strings. e.g., 1234 or 1111</li>
			<li>Avoid using common words. e.g., Password</li>
			<li>Use special characters. e.g., %, Â£, !, * etc</li>
			<li>Do not share your passwords with others!</li>

		</ol>

		<p>Select which passwords you think are secure below and type in your own to see how secure it is!</p>

		<h3>Things to remember!</h3>
		<p>Even if your password is very hard to guess, writing them all down in an unsecured area such as a notes page can reduce the security massively and they could be stolen! Make sure you store your passwords safely and DO NOT SHARE THEM!</p>
